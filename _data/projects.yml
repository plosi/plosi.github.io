- project: Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system for WASH facilities in the humanitarian sector
  role: Developer and Implementer
  duration: 2020 &mdash; 2021
  # url: "#"
  description: 'An Internet of Things (IoT) approach incorporating the LoRaWANâ„¢ 
  technology to monitor the response of an aquifer system to the sudden increase in demand. 
  Sensors installed in the field collect real-time data on groundwater levels, water quality, 
  yield and consumption. Readings are sent to a central gateway that feeds an online dashboard, 
  allowing the user to remotely monitor in real time the performance of the system and to implement 
  proper data analysis for long-term solutions.'

- project: Low cost controller for industrial automation
  role: Developer and Implementer
  duration: 2015
  # url: "#"
  description: 'By using an Arduino compatible industrial controller (www.industruino.com) 
  and an industrial 3G gateway, it is possible to remotely control a pump and treat plant 
  functioning as an emergency response action at a contaminated site. The plant consists of an 
  extraction well pumping contaminated ground water that is properly treated before its discharge. 
  The plant must run continuously, as it acts as a barrier to avoid the migration of the contamination. 
  Different sensors (pressure transducers, flow meters, water level switches, etc.) are connected to 
  the Arduino that forwards the readings through a secured VPN connection to a remote server, 
  where measurements are displayed in real time through a web page. Alarm notifications are sent via 
  SMS to alert for malfunctioning (pump stopped, dry well, etc.).'

- project: Down-well electrical conductivity logging device
  role: Project Manager
  duration: 2015
  url: 'https://github.com/plosi/spdt-yun'
  description: 'Using a Rapsberry Pi and electrical conductivity probes from Atlas Scientific, 
  we have designed and assembled a logging device for data acquisition during a single point dilution test 
  (SPD test). The device was built in order to meet the specific needs related to the field test protocol 
  and investigation scopes, whereas no commercial solution was available at a reasonable cost.
  The test was performed on a monitoring well installed in a contaminated site in Central Italy. 
  The device has proved to produce extremely reliable and accurate data.
  A paper was prepared to participate to the NICOLE Technology Award in 2015.'

- project: Automated Green Living Wall
  role: Project Manager and Implementer
  duration: 2013
  # url: "#"
  description: 'Within the project for the renovation of the company new offices, while pursuing (and obtaining) 
  LEED-CI certification (Gold), among a series of best practices aimed at reducing water consumption, 
  limiting wastes production, increasing overall energy efficiency, etc., we have focused on improving 
  the comfort perceived by the inhabitants, i.e. ourselves and any external visitor. 
  This has been achieved by selecting particular furnishings and materials based on their ergonomics and 
  environmental impact, and through the installation of a living green wall, located at the entrance of the office.
  The benefits of a living green wall are tremendous. In terms of physical atmosphere and space, 
  plants have a positive effect on the occupants, helping in reducing the sick building syndrome. 
  The system was entirely designed in-house and all the employees collaborated to the installation of the wall.
  In addition, a series of sensors were installed on the green wall to record different parameters 
  (such as water level in the underneath reservoir, nutrients concentration, lux levels, etc.) all connected 
  to a central management system. Future development include the installation of air quality sensors aimed at 
  recording the levels of carbon dioxide, relative humidity and air temperature, and certain pollutant gases 
  such as formaldehyde, benzene and nitrogen dioxide. Several studies have in fact demonstrated the capabilities 
  of indoor plants of filtering air pollutants and improving the overall indoor air quality.
  The brain consists of an Arduino microcontroller to which all sensors are connected and which reports 
  to a central gateway displaying the sensor readings on a web interface. Pump cycles, lights, etc., 
  can be remotely controlled through the web page.'
