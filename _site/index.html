          <p class="resume-item-copy">An Internet of Things (IoT) approach incorporating the LoRaWAN™ technology to monitor the response of an aquifer system to the sudden increase in demand.

          <p class="resume-item-copy">By using an Arduino compatible industrial controller (www.industruino.com) and an industrial 3G gateway, it is possible to remotely control a pump and treat plant functioning as an emergency response action at a contaminated site. The plant consists of an extraction well pumping contaminated ground water that is properly treated before its discharge. The plant must run continuously, as it acts as a barrier to avoid the migration of the contamination. Different sensors (pressure transducers, flow meters, water level switches, etc.) are connected to the Arduino that forwards the readings through a secured VPN connection to a remote server, where measurements are displayed in real time through a web page. Alarm notifications are sent via SMS to alert for malfunctioning (pump stopped, dry well, etc.).</p>

          <p class="resume-item-copy">Using a Rapsberry Pi and electrical conductivity probes from Atlas Scientific, we have designed and assembled a logging device for data acquisition during a single point dilution test (SPD test). The device was built in order to meet the specific needs related to the field test protocol and investigation scopes, whereas no commercial solution was available at a reasonable cost. The test was performed on a monitoring well installed in a contaminated site in Central Italy. The device has proved to produce extremely reliable and accurate data. A paper was prepared to participate to the NICOLE Technology Award in 2015.</p>

          <h4 class="resume-item-details" itemprop="description">Project Manager and Implementer  &bull; 2013</h4>
          <p class="resume-item-copy">Within the project for the renovation of the company new offices, while pursuing (and obtaining) LEED-CI certification (Gold), among a series of best practices aimed at reducing water consumption, limiting wastes production, increasing overall energy efficiency, etc., we have focused on improving the comfort perceived by the inhabitants, i.e. ourselves and any external visitor. This has been achieved by selecting particular furnishings and materials based on their ergonomics and environmental impact, and through the installation of a living green wall, located at the entrance of the office. The benefits of a living green wall are tremendous. In terms of physical atmosphere and space, plants have a positive effect on the occupants, helping in reducing the sick building syndrome. The system was entirely designed in-house and all the employees collaborated to the installation of the wall. In addition, a series of sensors were installed on the green wall to record different parameters (such as water level in the underneath reservoir, nutrients concentration, lux levels, etc.) all connected to a central management system. Future development include the installation of air quality sensors aimed at recording the levels of carbon dioxide, relative humidity and air temperature, and certain pollutant gases such as formaldehyde, benzene and nitrogen dioxide. Several studies have in fact demonstrated the capabilities of indoor plants of filtering air pollutants and improving the overall indoor air quality. The brain consists of an Arduino microcontroller to which all sensors are connected and which reports to a central gateway displaying the sensor readings on a web interface. Pump cycles, lights, etc., can be remotely controlled through the web page.</p>
